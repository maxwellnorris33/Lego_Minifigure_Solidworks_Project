## Abstract
This design project presented students with the opportunity to demonstrate their
Solidworks knowledge and model a household item of a minimum of 4 parts. For this project a
LEGO Minifigure was chosen to be modeled and drawings of its components along with its
assembly drawing rendered using Solidworks. A description for the major parts along with the
process and experience with Solidworks is then combined with the drawings in this report.

## Introduction
For this project I chose to model a LEGO Minifigure as my 4+ part household item. Each
part of the minifigure was modeled in Solidworks, of which drawings were then made and
attached in the appendix below. The parts were also used to make an assembly of the product
which is also represented by a Solidworks drawing in the appendix below.

## Description of the product
For this project I designed a replica of a LEGO Minifigure. A LEGO Minifigure is a
buildable small human toy figurine made of ABS plastic, it was first introduced in 1978. It is part
of the LEGO toy brand and so is compatible with other LEGO components. Its buildable nature
allows for the interchanging of different colored parts or the replacement of one if a part breaks.
The classic LEGO minifigure consists of 9 parts: a head, a torso, a wasit, two arms, two legs and
two hands. The legs, arms, hands and head are all able to rotate in 2 dimensions about the joint
they are attached with. The main method for joining the parts together is tight holes and friction,
as well custom clips on the arms.

## Description of the major parts
There are 9 parts in this assembly, 8 of which are distinct. The list of distinct parts is:
head (drawing 1 in the appendix), torso (drawing 2 in the appendix), waist (drawing 3 in the
appendix), hand (drawing 4 in the appendix), right/left legs (drawing 6 in the appendix),
right/left arms (drawing 7 in the appendix). Of the distinct parts the legs and arms are mirror
images of each other. Both hand parts are identical. All of the parts are designed to fit together
tightly to use friction to help hold it together. The Solidworks drawing of the assembly as
attached in the appendix below as drawing 5.

The head is arguably the most important piece in the lego Minifigure, this is due to the
wide variety of faces printed onto it, from the simple smiley face all the way to Darth Vader from
Star Wars have been printed onto it. It is a rounded cylinder with a hole in the bottom to attach to
the torso, and a hole and stud (name of the circles that stick out of the top of LEGO bricks) on
top to allow other LEGO pieces to be attached to the head. For more details view drawing 1 in
the appendix.

The Leg pieces are mostly hollow and have holes on the back and bottom to allow them
to attach to other LEGO bricks, they attach to the waist. For more details check the
undimensioned drawing 6 in the appendix below.
The waist piece connects the legs to the torso and allows the legs to rotate on an axle. The
portion at the top of the waist is shaped to fit snugly into the torso and stop it from sliding out
using friction. It is however easy to remove from the torso with light tensile force. Refer to
drawing 3 in the appendix for more details.

The torso piece connects the waist to the arms and heads, It is the biggest component of
the assembly. It is completely hollow with a large rectangular hole at the bottom for the waist to
attach, two holes on the sides for the arms and an axle on top to attach the head to attach to and
rotate on. Refer to drawing 2 in the appendix for more details.

The hand pieces slide into the arms using a shaft that is at an angle approximately 75
degrees from the back face of the hand. They are what the minifigure uses to hold other LEGO
components. It resembles a claw hand of sorts with a stick coming out the end at an angle to
attach it to the arm. For more information refer to drawing 4 in the appendix.
Lastly the arms, which attach the torso to the hands. They are free to rotate in two
dimensions around where they attach to the torso. Due to the special clip that holds them inside
the torso this piece is incredibly hard to remove from the torso without causing a small crack in
the torso. This piece also is the most rounded piece of any of the pieces in this model. For more
details view the undimensioned drawing 7 attached in the appendix below.

## Discussions on experience of Solidworks modeling
Due to the highly geometric nature of this product the most important Solidworks tools to
use were the extrude boss and extrude cut features. Some of the parts were also not at right
angles (in the hand and arm) this required the creation of reference planes at the appropriate
angle. In the hand part the extrude techniques to surface and offset were especially important in
creating the cuff at the start of the hand. The fillet feature was incredibly important as well as
many of the parts contained rounded portions such as the head or arms. The hardest part about
creating the Solidworks drawings was by far deciding where to position the dimensions to ensure
they looked clean and not overly cramped. The hand was by far the most challenging drawing to
make due to its interesting shape and lots of dimensions, but this also made it the most
interesting one to complete.
